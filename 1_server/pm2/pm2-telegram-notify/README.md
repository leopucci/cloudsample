pm2 set pm2-telegram-notify:error false
```

## Options

The following options are available:

- buffer (bool) - Enable/Disable buffering of messages by timestamp. Messages that occur with the same timestamp (seconds) will be concatenated together and posted as a single slack message. Default: true
- buffer_seconds (int) - Duration in seconds to aggregate messages. Has no effect if buffer is set to false. Min: 1, Max: 5, Default: 1
- queue_max (int) - Number of messages to keep queued before the queue will be truncated. When the queue exceeds this maximum, a rate limit message will be posted to slack. Min: 10, Max: 100, Default: 100

Set these options in the same way you subscribe to events.

Example: The following configuration options will enable message buffering, and set the buffer duration to 2 seconds. All messages that occur within 2 seconds of each other (for the same event) will be concatenated into a single slack message.

```
pm2 set pm2-telegram-notify:username pm2-user
pm2 set pm2-telegram-notify:buffer true
pm2 set pm2-telegram-notify:buffer_seconds 2
```
